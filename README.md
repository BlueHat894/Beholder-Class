Beholder Class in Java
Introduction

Objectives/Purpose
The Beholder class in Java is a blueprint for creating instances of Beholders, fictional creatures from the Dungeons & Dragons universe. The class is designed to serve as a blueprint for the definition and manipulation of various attributes, such as the Beholder's name, color, and abilities.

Background
Beholders are fascinating magical entities endowed with numerous eye stalks, each with a unique power. This Java class was made to highlight the essential characteristics and abilities of Beholders in a reusable object-oriented format.

Methodology
Inputs
name: Name of the Beholder (String)
radius: Physical size (double)
color: Skin color (String)
eyeColor: Eye color (String)
teeth: Type of teeth (String)
numEyeStalks: Number of eye stalks (int)

Outputs
Printed Beholder attributes
Text displaying abilities
Beholder attributes are initialized through one of three constructors.
Getters and setters allow manipulation of these attributes.
Abilities are invoked via specific methods.

Methods
fireEyeBeam(String beam): Executes an eye beam attack, where beam specifies the type. (can fire various eye beams)
levitate(): Makes the Beholder levitate, printing a descriptive text.
Variables
Private instance variables: name, radius, color, eyeColor, teeth, numEyeStalks
Calculations
N/A

Results

Findings
The Java class successfully enables the creation and manipulation of Beholder instances with a variety of attributes. It also provides methods for executing specific abilities tied to the creature. 

Significance
The class captures the complexities and functionalities of a Beholder, providing a robust toolset for simulating these magical creatures in a Java environment.

Conclusions
What Was Learned
The project was a hands-on experience in object-oriented programming, it focused on encapsulation, inheritance, and the creation of versatile constructors in Java. This project was instrumental in learning about default constructors.

Recommendations
Future updates may include:

Adding more abilities to the Beholder
Developing subclasses for specific types of Beholders
error checks or validation mechanisms
Calculations such as hit points, ability scores, and ability modifiers
